# terminal_velocity
A sim in development to simulate terminal velocity with the added bonus of interactive sliders to change mass of falling object and density of fluid.

#Box on a Ramp FBD
A sim in development to demonstrate how a box behaves on an adjustable ramp. The goal is to have the Box FBD displayed and responsive to changes in the ramp angle. The box will also begin to slide down the ramp when gravitational forces overcome fricitonal forces.
