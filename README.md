# terminal_velocity
A sim in development to simulate terminal velocity with the added bonus of interactive sliders to change mass of falling object and density of fluid.

#Box on a Ramp FBD
A sim in development to demonstrate how a box behaves on an adjustable ramp. The goal is to have the Box FBD displayed and responsive to changes in the ramp angle. The box will also begin to slide down the ramp when gravitational forces overcome fricitonal forces. 

#Projectile-vs-Freefall
A simple sim in developmentment to convey the concept that a horizontal velocity will not affect the the rate at which a body falls. Currently problems with acceleration within science lib and/or sketch.

#Torque on Wrench
A sim demonstrating how length of moment arm and magnitude and direction of applied force affect the produced torque. User uses a slider to change moment arm length and controls applied force my dragging force vector arrow tip.

#Projectile
Sim demonstrating projectile motion. User drags vector to set initial velocity and presses button to initiate. Still in first stages of development. Scaling of arrow object magnitude and mover object's (projectile's) velocity needs tweaking. Need to add and scale in (gravitational) acceleration vector.
